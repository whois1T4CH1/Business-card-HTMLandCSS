        <h1>Company - <span>Limpak Infoware PVT LTD.</span></h1>
        <div class="customerSerive">
            <h3>Designation - <span>Customer Service Executive</span></h3>
            <h3>November 1st, 2018 - November 23rd, 2020</h3>
            <p>
                As a Customer Service Executive for Limpak Infoware PVT LTD, I would be responsible for reaching out to
                citizens of the United Kingdom and United States to complete a lifestyle survey. This would involve
                using my
                communication skills to engage with potential customers and make sure the survey is completed accurately
                and
                efficiently.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to conducting surveys, I would also be there to address any customer service issues that
                might
                arise. This could include receiving calls from customers who have been contacted by unwanted companies.
                In
                these cases, I would take appropriate action to resolve the complaints, which could involve raising
                tickets
                and working closely with other departments to resolve the issue.
            </p>
            Having strong communication skills, both written and verbal, would be crucial in this role. I would need to
            be able to handle difficult situations with empathy and professionalism, and have strong organizational
            skills to effectively manage my workload.
            <p>
                In short, as a Customer Service Executive for Limpak Infoware PVT LTD, I would play a vital role in
                providing top-notch customer service and building strong relationships with potential customers through
                the
                completion of lifestyle surveys.
