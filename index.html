            <h1><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h1>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Mohammad Arham Alam and I am a tech-savvy person with a passion for both anime and
                coding.
                I
                have been an avid anime fan for as long as I can remember, and I have a deep appreciation for the unique
                and
                imaginative worlds that anime has to offer.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to my love for anime, I also have a strong interest in technology and programming. I have
                honed
                my coding skills over the years and I am proficient in multiple programming languages including Python
                and
                JavaScript, as well as HTML and CSS.
            </p>

            <p>
                Aside from my personal interests, I also have extensive experience in customer service, quality
                analysis,
                and escalation desk management. I have worked in these roles for several years, and I have developed a
                strong understanding of the importance of providing excellent customer service and handling difficult
                situations with grace and professionalism.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my previous roles, I have honed my communication skills and I have a knack for quickly resolving
                customer complaints and issues. I have also become an expert in problem-solving and I have a proven
                track record of successfully managing high-pressure situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I am a well-rounded individual with a passion for both anime and technology, and I have the
                skills and experience needed to succeed in a fast-paced, customer-focused environment.
